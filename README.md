## Project Insights

- Total Attrition: 238 employees (16.08%)
- Research & Development department has highest attrition (55.9%)
- Employees earning ≤ $5K salary account for 68.5% of attrition
- Age group 26–35 contributes highest attrition (48.7%)
- 68.5% attrition occurs within first 5 years of employment
- Sales and Laboratory Technician roles show higher attrition

## Final Conclusion
- The HR Analytics dashboard successfully identifies key factors contributing to employee attrition. The analysis shows that attrition is highest among early-career employees, lower salary groups, and specific departments such as Research & Development and Sales.
